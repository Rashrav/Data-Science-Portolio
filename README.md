# Data Science Portfolio

Author - Rashrav Shrestha

This repository contains the files for the Portfolio task for COMP2200/6200 in S1 2022. 


A Brief description of every portfolio task is provided below

### Portfolio Part 1
The main focus of this portfolio task is data exploration and preparation. 
Simple procedures such as removing missing values and outliers, displaying descriptive statistics were carried out. Upon exploring and preparing the data, appropriate plots were created to explore the correlation between different features and the rating score. 

### Portfolio Part 2

The primary focus of this task was training the linear regression models to predict user ratings towards movies. Included basic data science workflow which involved the process of exploring the data, building models, making predictions and evaluating results. The impacts of feature selection of the model were also explored. Experimentation with different training and testing sizes was also carried out. Finally, the models were evaluated and their accuracy on the testing data was visualized and proper conclusions were made. 


### Portfolio Part 3
The dataset used for this portfolio was still the movie lens dataset, however, the rating column was replaced with the feedback column. The main objective of this portfolio task was to build and evaluate a predictive model for the feedback variable. In this task, a Simple Logistic regression model, as well as the more advanced K-Nearest Neighbors, were used. A similar data science workflow was carried out which included the process of data preparation (Converting Categorical to Numerical Variable). Recursive Feature Estimation was implemented to determine how many number of features had high accuracy scores. The optimal K value for the KNN model was also determined. Finally, the confusion matrix between the two models was compared and valid conclusions were provided.


### Portfolio Part 4
The titanic dataset which was obtained from Kaggle was used for this portfolio task. The high-level goal of the project was divided into four different parts:
- Data Exploration: Finding out the Correlations, Visualizing different variables, and gaining useful insights.
- Data Preparation: Applying necessary preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for modeling. This involves the process of checking for null values, outliers, etc.
- Data Modeling: Building and Evaluating predictive models for Survival from available Features. Firstly, a simple logistic regression model is used and its accuracy is evaluated. After that, a function consisting of all the applicable supervised learning models covered in the lectures is created and its level of accuracy is evaluated.
- Selecting the Machine Learning Best Model: The performance and accuracy of different machine learning models are compared with each other and the model with the best accuracy in predicting the survivability is determined.

The last portfolio task was more flexible as I got to choose my own dataset and present on my own analysis.
